# Task Manager
## Description
This project was undertaken as part of a coding bootcamp. This was the fifth challenege for the bootcamp. The goal was to create a task manager using jqery and bootstrap. A modal should pop up and ask the user for the task title, task descript, and the due date. after adding the task a card with theuser input pops up in the todo column. The card color changes based on the due date of the task. white if in the future, yellow if same day and red if past the date. The user can drag and drop the cards into the three different catagories. Finally each card has a delete button that removes the task.
